use sql_store;

-- using the UNION operator we can combine the result of multiple queries.
-- if the first select is selecting one column, also the second query should select only column, while we are using the UNION operator.

-- first example
select
    order_id,
    order_date,
    'Active' AS status
from orders
where order_date >= '2019-01-01'
union
select
    order_id,
    order_date,
    'Archived' AS status
from orders
where order_date < '2019-01-01';

-- second example
select first_name
from customers
union
select name
from shippers;

-- third example
select name
from shippers
union
select first_name
from customers;

-- exercise
-- customer_id | first_name | points | type
-- point < 2000 ___ Bronze
-- point >= 2000 and point <= 3000 ___ Silver
-- point > 3000 ___ Gold
-- Order the result by first name

-- first solutiom
select
    customer_id,
    first_name,
    points,
    case
         when points <= 2000 then 'Bronze'
         when points <= 3000 then 'Silver'
         else 'Gold'
       end as type
from customers
order by first_name;

-- second solution
select
    customer_id,
    first_name,
    points,
    'Bronze' as type
from customers
where points < 2000
union
select
    customer_id,
    first_name,
    points,
    'Silver' as type
from customers
where points between 2000 and 3000
union
select
    customer_id,
    first_name,
    points,
    'Gold' as type
from customers
where points > 3000
order by first_name;
