-- if you type only join, this means inner joins

select
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    o.order_id
from customers c
join orders o 
    on c.customer_id = o.customer_id
order by c.customer_id;


-- we would like to see also customers that haven't place an order. How to do? We can use an HASHMAP! (joking).
-- we can use OUTER JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN); the OUTER keyword is optional.

select
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    o.order_id
from customers c
left join orders o 
    on c.customer_id = o.customer_id
order by c.customer_id;

select
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    o.order_id
from orders o
right outer join customers c 
    on c.customer_id = o.customer_id
order by c.customer_id;


-- Exercise
-- join products/t with order_items/t
-- product_id, name, quantity

select 
   p.product_id, 
   p.name, 
   oi.quantity
from products p 
left join order_items oi
    on p.product_id = oi.product_id;
